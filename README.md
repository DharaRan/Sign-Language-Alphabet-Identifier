# Sign-Language-Alphabet-Identifier
Biomedical Engineering Pattern Recogition Project.
My team and I implemented k-nearest neighbor to identify hand signs of the letter sign langauge alphabet. 
We used a fiber optic glove for read different signals when different hand signs where made. 
So the hand sign for "A" would output a different signal compared to the hand sign for "B".
The k that would really well for this project 1.
